// Significance of orpan process:
/*Orphan process can be usedfor significant purposes. 
A process can be intentionally orphaned to keep it running for exmaple: running in the background or running it for long sessions which donâ€™t need any manual intervention and going to take long time, then we can detach from user session.
The orphans process are running without parent in detached session.
Also in case of crash of parent process, the child process (orphan process) can be helpful in many ways. */
